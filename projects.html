                            I have created a Library Management app using the customTkinter library in Python. The app is a modern and user-friendly way to manage your library. It features a dark mode, which can be switched on or off depending on your preference. The app also allows you to track your books, add new books, and checkout books.
                            I am excited to share this app with the world and I hope you find it useful.</p>

It is made in React, a popular JavaScript framework that is known for its ease of use and scalability. The game is easy to learn but difficult to master, and it is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.
                            The game is played by rolling 10 dice and trying to get all of them to land on the same number. If you are able to do this, you shout "Tenzies!" and win the game. If you are unable to get all of the dice to land on the same number, you lose the game.
