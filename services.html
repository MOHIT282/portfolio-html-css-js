                    <p>I'm on an exciting journey to learn about data science and machine learning. I'm becoming skilled at using a computer language called Python to work with data and create graphs that show patterns. I'm also learning how to use math to understand data better.
                      Right now, I'm focused on understanding how computers can learn from data. I use a special tool called Jupyter Notebook to practice and keep track of what I'm learning. I welcome new ideas in this field and how they can solve real-world problems.
                      I'm really passionate about turning all this learning into practical solutions for everyday issues.</p>
