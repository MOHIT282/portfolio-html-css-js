            <h2>A Intiutive game built using React Js</h2>
            <p>The Tenzies game is a simple yet addictive dice game that can be played by anyone. It is made in React, a
              popular JavaScript framework that is known for its ease of use and scalability. The game is easy to learn
              but difficult to master, and it is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.
              The game is played by rolling 10 dice and trying to get all of them to land on the same number. If you are
              able to do this, you shout "Tenzies!" and win the game. If you are unable to get all of the dice to land
              on the same number, you lose the game.
